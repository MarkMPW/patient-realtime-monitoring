# Agnos Patient realtime monitoring

This project is a responsive web-based form designed for patients to submit their personal information. The submitted data is displayed in real-time to staff members through a dedicated interface. Staff can also monitor the activity status of each patientâ€”whether they are active or inactive. The user interface is fully responsive and optimized for use across all device screen sizes.

## To run project

git clone https://github.com/MarkMPW/patient-realtime-monitoring.git
